# State of California ED Hospital Volume Database Tool
# built with REACT and alaSQL to perform SQL queries


It uses data from the State of California's Department of Health Care Access and Analytics Branch. The data can be found here: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/emergency-department-volume-and-capacity The data is then parsed using the alaSQL package. This package also functions as a database in the browser (cool right).      So that the tool can perform specific queries based on the user's inputs.

There is not server side to this. REACT is client side, and so is the SQL app. 
Anyone can easily download and try it out!
