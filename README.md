# California Emergency Department Hospital Volume Database Application
# Developed using REACT and alaSQL for SQL query execution

This tool utilizes data provided by the Department of Health Care Access and Analytics Branch of the State of California. You can access the data at this link: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/emergency-department-volume-and-capacity. The data is processed using the alaSQL package, which serves as a database within the browser. This allows the tool to execute particular SQL queries in response to the inputs from the user.

This is entirely client-side; both the REACT and the SQL application operate on the client side. It's straightforward for anyone to download and experiment with!
