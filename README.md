# State of California ED Hospital Database Tool
# built with REACT and alaSQL to perform SQL queries


It uses data from the State of California's Department of Health Care Access and Analytics Branch. The data can be found here: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/emergency-department-volume-and-capacity The data is then parsed using the alaSQL package. This package also functions as a database in the browser (cool right).      So that the tool can perform specific queries based on the user's inputs.
